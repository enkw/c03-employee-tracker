# c03-employee-data
## Description

The goal of this was to fix the provided code so that the application is able to, once the button is clicked,
track the entered employee information (name, last name, and salary) and provide an average to the salaries provided.

The low amount of commits for this repo is due to me having to move the repo from https://github.com/enkw/c03-employee-data in an attempt to fix an issue I was having with github pages.
